## üìÇ Key Directories

### `cmd/`

Contains CLI entry points.

* `{{.ProjectName}}`: The root executable command.
* Subdirectories may define other command-line tools or utilities as needed.

### `pkg/`

Reusable Go packages structured for modularity.

* `config/`: Configuration loading and validation logic.
* `utils/`: Generic helper functions used across the codebase.
* `{{.ProjectName}}/`: Core project logic, structured by domain.

## üìå Structure Principles

This layout follows these principles:

* **Clarity**: All files and folders serve a clear, active role.
* **Modularity**: Separation by domain and concern.
* **No placeholders**: All items are meaningful and ready to be used.
* **Best Practices First**: Includes tooling and metadata expected in real-world projects.
