# ðŸ“¦ Versioning Strategy â€” `{{.ProjectName}}`

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org), 
using clear and reproducible version tags to communicate meaningful changes.

---

## ðŸ§© Format

Versions follow the format:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

Examples:

* `1.0.0` â€” First stable release
* `1.2.3` â€” Patch update on the second feature release

---

## ðŸ”– Release Principles

* All releases are tagged using the `vX.Y.Z` format
* Pre-release identifiers like `-beta.1`, `-rc.1`, or `-dev.2` are allowed when necessary

---

## ðŸ”¬ Optional Pre-Releases

When needed, pre-release builds may follow SemVer suffixes:

* `v1.0.0-beta.1`
* `v1.1.0-rc.1`
* `v2.0.0-dev.2`

These versions signal unstable or preview builds before a final release.
