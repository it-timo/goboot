# üõ† Development Workflow ‚Äî `goboot`

This file describes the early development approach for `goboot`.  
It prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and clean layering during the initial stages.

> As `goboot` evolves, this workflow will expand ‚Äî see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).

## üì¶ Project Standards

| Area          | Practice                                                             |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structure     | Use `cmd/`, `pkg/`, `configs/`, `templates/`, and `doc/` directories |
| Versioning    | Semantic versioning (`v0.x.x`) with clearly defined milestones       |
| Licensing     | MIT license in `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`                                |
| Documentation | Markdown-based (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, ADRs)                     |
| Philosophy    | No runtime magic, minimal indirection, deterministic scaffolding     |

### üîÄ Branching

| Type       | Prefix    |
|------------|-----------|
| Features   | `feat/*`  |
| Fixes      | `fix/*`   |
| Chores     | `chore/*` |
| Planning   | `docs/*`  |

> All work happens on branches. Merge into `main` only when stable and reviewed.

## ‚úÖ Commit Conventions

```text
feat: Add support for base project target dir
fix: Correct YAML parsing edge case
docs: Add ADR for service registration
chore: Prepare v0.0.1 release tag
````

## üì¶ Releases (Manual for Now)

1. Complete and test the milestone
2. Update `ROADMAP.md` and optionally `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create annotated tag:

   ```bash
   git tag v0.0.1 -m "Release v0.0.1 ‚Äî Adds base_project rendering logic"
   git push origin v0.0.1
   ```

## üìö Planning Files

This project uses:

* [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) ‚Äî Development layers and milestones
* [`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) ‚Äî Directory design rationale
* [`doc/adr/`](./doc/adr) ‚Äî Architecture decisions (ADRs)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* This is a **developer tool**, not a runtime framework
* All logic must be explicit, safe, and maintainable
* Avoid runtime "magic," reflection, or abstract factories
