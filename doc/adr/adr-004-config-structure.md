## ðŸ“„ ADR-004: Config System Structure and Philosophy

**Tags:** `config`, `modular-design`, `idiomatic-go`

## Status
âœ… Accepted

### Context

Modern Go tools benefit from modular and declarative configuration, but many systems introduce runtime in-direction, 
reflection, or plugin hooks that obscure behavior and reduce maintainability.

The `goboot` project needs a configuration system that is:

* Predictable
* Fully typed
* Declarative but explicit
* Idiomatic and traceable

This applies both to how configs are defined and how they are loaded, validated, and used.

### Decision

Implement a centralized `config` package that provides:

* A `ServiceConfig` interface for static config modules (e.g., base project, linting, Docker)
* A `Manager` that registers, validates, and exposes these modules
* A `GoBoot` type that acts as entry point and orchestrator

### Advantages

* Fully typed: All configs are concrete Go structs, no dynamic maps or generics
* Centralized: Validation, loading, and usage happen in well-defined places
* Predictable: No runtime injection or service hooks
* Scalable: New config modules can be added without changing the core behavior

### Disadvantages

* All config modules must be hardcoded in `createServiceConfig()`
* Cannot dynamically register config types at runtime
